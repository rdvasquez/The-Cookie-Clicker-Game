# The-Cookie-Clicker-Game

I believe to have been able to achieve the basic requirements laid out for this assignment.

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve? Areas of improvement are confined in writing JavaScript for a little complex application to make the game much more interactive.Â  However, for my level having a simple script for a basic application that works has been achieved.

ðŸŽ¯ If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks? The most difficult part is to get the HTML structure, styling through CSS and getting the script align to my overall plan and make it work as how it's envisioned to be. It's clear to me what the main goal is, however, the process of getting there requires a trial and error exploration that eats up most of my time.Â
